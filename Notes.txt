The game is designed around strict determinism: all players see the same world state, outcomes, and transitions, even though individual players may temporarily experience private, non-deterministic visual events. Core gameplay operates in discrete ticks, with entities (tanks, ghosts, foes, food, potions) spawned deterministically based on room name, usernames, and a shared seed. Health, collisions, deaths, and level transitions are all computed identically on every client, ensuring that entity removal, survivorship, and end-state hashes are verifiable and reproducible across browsers.

Private, non-deterministic stimuli (e.g., a bird, bat, or hallucination sprite) are used as psychological triggers rather than gameplay mechanics. These private visuals encourage players to type specific words or commands in chat (e.g., “bird,” “nuts,” “squirrel”), which then act as deterministic inputs. When a chat keyword is detected, it triggers shared, deterministic events visible to all players, such as spawning a new enemy, rotating the camera, or transitioning to a new level. In this way, discovery and progression emerge organically from player behavior while preserving a shared, authoritative game state.
